/**
 * **SaaS / billing plans**
 *
 * The **Free** tier is implicit: a user with no active subscription is on Free
 * (see the free-tier limits enforced in the ingest/creation paths). The **Pro**
 * plan below is pushed to Stripe by `createStripeProduct()` — `pricing[].key`
 * becomes the Stripe `lookup_key` the checkout resolves. Self-hosted
 * deployments leave the `STRIPE_*` env vars unset, so billing is inert and
 * every feature is unlocked.
