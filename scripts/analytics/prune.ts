/**
 * Retention purge — delete analytics rows older than the retention window.
 *
 *   GHOST_RETENTION_DAYS=395 bun scripts/analytics/prune.ts [--dry-run]
 *
 * Scheduled to run daily (see app/Scheduler.ts). With `GHOST_RETENTION_DAYS`
 * unset or 0, retention is DISABLED and nothing is deleted — data is kept
 * indefinitely until an operator opts in to a window. Visitor rows are already
 * pseudonymous (24h-rotating hash, no stored IP), so this is data-minimisation,
 * not erasure of personal data. See issue #4.
 *
 * Timestamps are stored as ISO-8601 varchars, which sort lexicographically, so a
 * plain `"<column>" < cutoff` compare selects exactly the expired rows.
